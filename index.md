Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a Software Engineer at [Google][google],
where I work in the Gmail Security Team. I joined the team in March 2016 after
my Ph.D. graduation and I'm thrilled to be on board. Among other things, I
dabble with HTML Sanitization, JavaScript sandboxing and Gmail's Antivirus
service.

Most of my work is confidential. However, I am also working on the non-
confidential [Closure HTML Sanitizer][htmlsanitizer], which is open sourced on
Github. The sanitizer leverages the browser's own parser for accurate and fast
sanitization, and lately I am focusing on improving its flexibility to cover
all possible client-side use cases within Google and within the open-source
community.

Before joining Google, I was a Ph.D. student at [Stony Brook University][sbu],
working in [R. Sekar][sekar]'s [Secure Systems Laboratory][seclab]. My main
area of interest was Web Security. During my studies, I worked on
[XSS][xssfilt] and [CSRF][jcsrf] detection and prevention, [isolation and
policy enforcement of untrusted JavaScript code][jate], and [principled web
application development using the Spreadsheet paradigm][websheets]. You can
read more details in my [Research][research] page.

Although I have left the academia for the industry, I am still exploring new
research avenues and plan to actively publish both within Google and on my own
time with my former Ph.D. advisor. You can find an updated list of
publications in my [Publications][publications] page.
